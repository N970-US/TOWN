                        Established 1990 by the Hu√°ng family, TOWN has stayed loyal to its roots, growing from a humble size to it's newly renovated location on Main Street, New York, the same borough the resturaunt was created to serve. Originally designed to create a refined space for locals in the community, TOWN's reputation rapidly grew into the place to be for fine dining in Queens.
